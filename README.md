## Hi there 👋

I’m Chieh-An Chang — a chill 🏝️ double-major in Computer Science & Statistics at the University of Toronto (Class of 2025 🎓). 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on applying Geometric Brownian Motion and MCMC to stock market data 💹, plus building LSTM models in PyTorch 🔥 just for fun.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning about new ways to make sense of data, whether it’s ANOVA tests, travel prediction models with scikit-learn 🚀, or exploring Docker 🐳 to streamline workflows.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects and machine learning experiments — especially the ones that need a dash of statistics magic ✨.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with creative ideas to turn complex data into meaningful insights for real-world impact.
- 💬 Ask me about probability distributions, Python 🐍, R 📊, or the art of being a TA while juggling coding sessions.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ranked 6th in a Kaggle competition 🏅 and I’ve been on the Dean’s List 🏆 a couple of times — proof that stats and coffee go hand in hand ☕.

Thanks for stopping by and feel free to explore my repos or drop a line. Let’s build something awesome together 🤝!
