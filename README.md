Hi there 👋

I'm **Chieh-An (Andy) Chang** — a Master's student in **Data Science & AI (CO-OP)** at the **University of Waterloo** 🎓 (Expected Graduation: 12/2026 ~ 04/2027). I recently graduated with **High Distinction** from the University of Toronto (CS & Stats).

* 🤖 I'm currently diving deep into my Master's coursework, focusing on **AI** and **ML/Deep Learning** (using **PyTorch** & **TensorFlow**). I also have a solid foundation in **Python, Java, C,** and **SQL**.
* 🚀 I'm passionate about building and learning new tech. My project experience includes developing in **Unix/Linux environments**, containerizing with **Docker**, and setting up **CI/CD** to **automate testing workflows**.
* 🤝 I'm **actively seeking Summer 2026 co-op/internship opportunities** in Software Engineering, Data Science, or AI/ML Engineering. I'm eager to apply my project experience in **A/B testing**, **machine learning**, and **full-stack development** to real-world problems.
* 👨‍🏫 Ask me about building end-to-end ML solutions, designing **A/B tests**, or my experience as a TA for **Databases (SQL)** and **Statistics**.
* 📬 How to reach me: [**LinkedIn**](https://linkedin.com/in/chiehanchang) or email: **c84chang@uwaterloo.ca**.
* ✨ Pronouns: He/Him
